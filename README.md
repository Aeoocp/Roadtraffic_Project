   - Pycharm 
   
##YOLOX and DeepSORT

Object tracking implemented with YOLOX, DeepSort, and TensorFlow.

YOLOX is one version of YOLO (algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detections), with a better performance. You can check out on [THIS LINK](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) to see more impormation about YOLOX.

DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) used for building highly accurate object trackers. Check out on [THIS LINK](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07402.pdf) to see more impormation about DeepSORT.
